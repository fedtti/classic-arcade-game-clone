# Classic Arcade Game Clone

A Frogger clone in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Getting Started

In order to play the game, you may either [try it online](https://codepen.io/fedtti/full/pLwjao/) or run it locally (see [Installing](#installing)).

### Instructions

Move around the map with the arrow keys to reach the water and start a new level, collecting gems and avoiding bugs. You have three lives.

## Installing

While the Udacity mentors suggest using `SimpleHTTPServer` in Python, being a front-end developer I prefer [the http-server package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) of Node.js. If you know what you’re doing, it’s up to you! :wink:

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

Once you installed all the prerequisites, open a terminal emulator and execute the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/fedtti/classic-arcade-game-clone
cd classic-arcade-game-clone/
npm install http-server -g
http-server
```

Open a browser and point it to `http://localhost:8080/`.
