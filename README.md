# Classic Arcade Game Clone

A Frogger clone in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Getting Started

In order to play the game, you have to run a local server.

## Installing

While the @udacity mentors suggest using `SimpleHTTPServer` in Python, being a front-end developer I prefer the `http-server` package of Node.js.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

Once you installed all the prerequisites, open a terminal emulator and execute the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/fedtti/classic-arcade-game-clone
cd classic-arcade-game-clone/
npm install http-server -g
http-server
```

Open a browser and point it to `http://localhost:8080/`.
